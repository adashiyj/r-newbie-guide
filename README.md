# R Newbie Guide üê£
Hi there, welcome to visit this public repository of learning R as a newbie. If you have a Social Science background, have no or little programming experience, would like to stop spending money on statistical softwares (e.g., SPSS, STATA), and eager to learn R in a productive way, then you're at the right place!‚ú®

## Me and R
I'm a Communication Science research master's student at the University of Amsterdam. My story with R began not too long ago, as I started to learn this programming language in October 2024. I had some programming experience in Python when I was an undergraduate student. However, speaking from someone who's not tech-savy, it is still challenging and sometimes frustrating as I keep trying to get better with programming in R.

To support Open Science, I will keep updating helpful learning materials in this repository.
