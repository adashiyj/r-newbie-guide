# R Newbie Guide 🐣
Hi there, welcome to visit this public repository of learning R as a newbie. If you have a Social Science background, have absolutely NO programming experience, would like to stop spending money on statistical softwares (e.g., SPSS, STATA), and eager to learn programming in a fun and easy way, then you're at the right place!✨

## Me and R
I'm a CS (Computer Science ❌ Communication Science ✅) research master's student at the University of Amsterdam. My story with R began on a rainy and windy Tuesday afternoon (typical Dutch weather🤷) at the Roeterseiland campus in Amsterdam...
