# R Newbie Guide üê£
Hi there, welcome to visit this public repository of learning R as a newbie. If you have a Social Science background, have absolutely NO programming experience, would like to stop spending money on statistical softwares (e.g., SPSS, STATA), and eager to learn programming in an easy and productive way, then you're at the right place!‚ú®

## Me and R
I'm a Communication Science research master's student at the University of Amsterdam. My story with R began not too long ago, as I started to learn this programming language in October 2024. I had some programming experience in Python when I was an undergraduate student. However, speaking from someone who's not tech-savy, it was still challenging and sometimes frustrating when I began to learn R. Luckily, the feeling of frustration is temporary. Once you master the basics, you'll feel a sense of achievement and motivated to learn more.
